 *  exception, the user can implement the delegate methods such as didFailWithError
 *  and didFailWithException. In those methods they can check userInfo to see if
 *  contains a key called "AWSClockSkewError". If it is there then it should have 
 *  a boolean value representing if it is clock skew error and the device clock skew
 *  has been adjusted. The client can now retry and the subsequent request should not
