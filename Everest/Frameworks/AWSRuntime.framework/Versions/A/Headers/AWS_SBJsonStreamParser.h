 @brief Parse a stream of JSON data.
 
 Using this class directly you can reduce the apparent latency for each
 download/parse cycle of documents over a slow connection. You can start
 parsing *and return chunks of the parsed document* before the entire
 document is downloaded.
 
 Using this class is also useful to parse huge documents on disk
 bit by bit so you don't have to keep them all in memory.
