 *
 * Amazon S3 is storage for the Internet. It is designed to make web-scale computing easier for developers.
 * Amazon S3 provides a simple web services interface that can be used to store and retrieve any amount of data,
 * at any time, from anywhere on the web. It gives any developer access to the same highly scalable, reliable,
 * fast, inexpensive data storage infrastructure that Amazon uses to run its own global network of web sites.
 * The service aims to maximize benefits of scale and to pass those benefits on to developers.
