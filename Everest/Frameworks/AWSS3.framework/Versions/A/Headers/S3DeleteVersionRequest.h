/** Provides options for deleting a specific version of an object in the specified bucket.
 * Once deleted, there is no method to restore or undelete an object version.
 * This is the only way to permanently delete object versions that are protected
 * by versioning.
 *
 * Because deleting an object version is permanent and irreversible, it is a
 * privileged operation that only the owner of the bucket containing the version
 * may perform.
 *
 * An owner can only delete a version of an object if the owner has enabled versioning for
 * their bucket.
 *
 * Note: When attempting to delete an object that does not exist,
 * Amazon S3 returns a success message, not an error message.
 *
 * <br />Required Parameters: bucket, key
